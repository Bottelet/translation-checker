# Translation Checker for Laravel
Translation Checker is tool designed to help you find translations you forgot to add to your language files, check, and maintain translations in your project. It provides a set of commands to help with language files, ensuring consistency and completeness across your translations.

It works with Laravel and supports various frontend frameworks like Vue.js, React, and Svelte.

and as default looks for translations in the `app/` and `resources/` folders.
## Installation
You can install the package via composer: 

```bash
composer require bottelet/translation-checker --dev
```

## Configuration
The Translation Checker can be configured using a PHP configuration file. This file allows you to set up translation services, specify source paths, and define the language folder.

The standard config tries to keep up with Laravel's default structure, but you can customize it if you need by publishing the configuration file.

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Bottelet\TranslationChecker\TranslationCheckerServiceProvider"
```

## Available Commands

1. **translations:check** - Check, manage, and update translations
2. **translations:clean** - Clean translations by removing unused keys
3. **translations:find-missing** - Find and add missing translations
4. **translations:sort** - Sort translation files
5. **translations:sync** - Sync translations between language files

## General Usage

To use Translation Checker, run the desired command in your terminal, followed by any required arguments or options. Each command is designed to help with a specific aspect of translation management.

The `check` command is particularly versatile. It scans the specified `source_paths` to find missing translations, can add them to your language files, and even translate them using the configured translation service.
