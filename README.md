# Translation Checker
Translation Checker is tool designed to help you find translations you forgot to add to your language files, check, and maintain translations in your project. It provides a set of commands to help with language files, ensuring consistency and completeness across your translations.

It works with Laravel and supports various frontend frameworks like Vue.js, React, and Svelte.


## How it works
1. Scan Source Files: The system looks through your code for strings that need translation.
2. Check Language Files: It then checks if these strings exist in your language files.
3. Add missing translation keys: It adds the missing key with empty values if there is no translation service used.

### Example:

`lang.json`
```json
{
  "test.value": "Value"
}
```

```php
<?php
class TestClass
{
    public function getValue()
    {
        return __('translate this string');
    }
}
```
```bash 
php artisan translations:check en
```
`lang.json`
```json
{
  "test.value": "Value",
  "translate this string": ""
}
```

## Quick Start
